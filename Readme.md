# Assignment
### Multicall-Based Uniswap Price Retrieval Solution

**Objective:** To develop a solution that leverages the concept of multicalls to efficiently retrieve multiple token prices from *Uniswap*, by reducing the number of calls to the blockchain node.
## Deliverables

1.  A solution that allows the user to input an index of desired token prices.
2.  The solution should return the prices of all the selected tokens in a single call.
3.  The solution should be efficient and have a significant improvement over the traditional method of making multiple separate API requests for each token price.

## Requirements

1.  The solution must be implemented using Solidity programming language and JavaScript (if needed).
2.  The solution should be thoroughly tested and documented.
3.  The code should be well-structured and easy to understand.
4.  The solution must be submitted as a GitHub repository, accompanied by a plain and simple dummy frontend if possible.

## Notes
1.  Please ensure that the solution meets the requirements and deliverables before submitting.
2. You can use official Uniswap docs at https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/overview
3.  If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.
4.  The final submission should be made through the provided GitHub link.
